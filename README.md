Hey! I'm a single guy working on this project, I have to do the sprite editing,
programming, testing, concept write-ups, bug tracking. All by myself, so it is
going to be a decently large and long journey. If you are interested, drop a star
on the github so I know (It makes my heart fuzzy). I will try to keep daily commits
going and hopefully push out a Beta release soon! - Nicholas N Ryan (Kowagatte).
